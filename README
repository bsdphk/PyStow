Welcome to the 3rd generation of "stow"
---------------------------------------

Stow is a backup/archive/timetravel tool I wrote in the late 1990ies
and still use.

The basic principle is that you have collections ("Home", "Pictures",
"Documents" etc) and you snapshot them to your Stow archive when
you feel like it.

A snapshot is a textfile specifying what is in the collection right
now, including a MD5 checksum for all files.

The server stashes this textfile and parses it and requests any
files with unknown MD5 checksums.

The resulting archive saves only one copy of each file which saves
a great deal of space.

This version of stow is a rewrite to Python, and not yet complete,
but more and more of the tools will probably be ported over as time
goes by.


Stow Silos
----------

Stow stores stuff in flat files called "silos", once a silo is full
(default size is 3GB to avoid using the outher rim of DVDs) the
next silo will be created.  Silos are named named "STOW%04d.SLO"

Each silo has a file which caches the index, if you remove 
index files ("STOW%04d.IDX") they will be regenerated.

... More later.
